Hello World! I'm Matthew (he/him) and I'm just getting into the world of coding. I've been a few places on my journey up to here. I was a wedding and portrait photographer for over ten years, worked in the non-profit sector, and more recently started a [woodworking business](https://www.zoewoodworks.com) selling wood art and home goods. I love to learn new things and I am very excited to dive into this new adventure.
