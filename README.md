Hello World! I'm Matthew (he/him) and I'm just getting into the world of coding. I've been a few places on my journey up to here. I was a wedding and portrait photographer for over ten years, worked in the non-profit sector, and more recently started a [woodworking business](https://www.zoewoodworks.com) selling wood art and home goods. I love to learn new things and I am very excited to dive into this new adventure.

### Class 1

##### Reading notes

*A growth mindset is important to success in this program*
- A love of learning
  - Intelligence and talent are not fixed traits and can be developed through perseverance and effort
- Keep trying
- Ask for help
- Keep reminders around of where you started from
- Obstacles
  - don't lose focus when hitting a roadblock *stay on target* 
  - Put in the effort - <sub>Don't hit the snooze button</sub> 


- Mind the gap (spaces matter both after the markdown and carriage returns after headings)
- Q: What are some bad habits to avoid at the beginning of my coding journey? double spaces after a line?
