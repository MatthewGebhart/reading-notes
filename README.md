##### Reading notes

*A growth mindset is important to success in this program*
- A love of learning
  - Intelligence and talent are not fixed traits and can be developed through perseverance and effort
- Keep trying
- Ask for help
- Keep reminders around of where you started from
- Obsticles
  - don't lose focus when hitting a roadblock *stay on target*  


- Mind the gap (spaces matter both after the markdown and carraige returns after headeings)
- Q: What are some bad habits to avoid at the beginning of my coding journey? double spaces after a line?
