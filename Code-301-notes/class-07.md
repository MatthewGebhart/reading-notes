- In the Carnegie Mellon study, the best teams shared two behaviors
  - Members spoke in roughly the same proportion "equality in distribution of conventional turn-taking"
    - Some people spoke more during different tasks, leadership shifted from assignment to assignment. But by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. 
  - Secondly, the good teams all had high "average social sensitivity" - they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
    - "Reading the Mind in the Eyes test - photos of someone eyes and asked to describe what they were thinking or feeling. 
- important: a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. - "Psychological safety"
  - this is somewhat messy and difficult to implement
- Make extra effort to let team members know how their work fit in the larger mission
- try harder to notice when someone is feeling excluded or down. 
- In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.

## How I explained REST to my brother

(source credit: https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)
- Who is Roy Fielding?
  - A smart guy who helped write HTTP and the first web servers and did a ton of research to explain why the web works the way it does.
- Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  - most computers just need to talk to a small group of machines
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  - it's all about applying verbs to nouns. HTTP allows the browser to get a web page.
- What does a `GET` do? - allows HTTP to retrieve information.
- What does a `POST` do? - allows one system to add something to another system
- What does `PUT` do? - replace something in another system
- What does `PATCH` do? - partially update something in another system.


## Things I want to know more about

- I'm curious about how we will be using these verbs to communicate with servers and what they will allow us to do.
