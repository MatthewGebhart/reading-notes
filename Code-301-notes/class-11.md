- Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
    	SQL		                //            NoSQL
Relational Databases (RDBMS)  //  non-relational or distributed database.  
table based databases  //  document based, key-value pairs, graph databases...
predefined schema  //  dynamic schema for unstructured data
uses SQL ( structured query language ) // focused on collection of documents

-  What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    - complex query intensive environment
- Give a real world example.
    - MySQL Community Edition
- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    - hierarchial data storage following key-value pairs, large data sets
- Give a real world example.
    - MongoDB
- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    - NoSQL
- Which type of database is best for scalability?
    - NoSQL because they are horizontally scalable. Just add more servers.

- What does SQL stand for?
    - Structured Query Language
- What is a relational database?
    - works with certain assumptions and tables
- What type of structure does a relational data base work with?
    - Tables
- What is a ‘schema’?
    - the organizational structure the data is stored in, the "rules"
- What is a NoSQL database?
    - A schema-less non-relational database
- How does it work?
    - no schema, no relations, relational data needs to be merged manually
- What is inside of a Mongo database?
    - less relation merging, super fast queries, 
- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
    - There is no clear winner, they both have different strengths
- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    - you can't rely on your data to have a certain field, if you have a lot of write requests that write in multiple collections

## Things I want to know more about

- I have zero experience with databases so a lot of the terminology is foreign to me. I hope to learn more about the basics of how databases work.
