## Things I want to know more about

## JavaScript Object Basics

- An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality
- usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects)
- an object literal â€” we've literally written out the object contents as we've come to create it
- It is very common to create an object using an object literal when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner
- Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually
- easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.
- Dot Notation
  - person.age
  - The object name (person) acts as the namespace
  - Next you write a dot, then the item you want to access 
  - this can be the name of a simple property, an item of an array property, or a call to one of the object's methods
