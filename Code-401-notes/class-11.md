- JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.
- supports many file formats
- jupyter Notebooks allow the use of data and code simultaneously 
- you can frame equations in markdown by framing with $s ex $ x^2 $
- Jupyter shortcuts
    - `y` cellformat: code
    - `m` cellformat: markdown
    - shift + enter: run cell 

### NumPy Turorial
[Source Credit](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)
- Numerical Python
- a commonly used Python data analysis package
- the number of dimensions is called the rank, and each dimension is called an axis. So the rows are the first axis, and the columns are the second axis.
- One of the limitations of NumPy is that all the elements in an array have to be of the same type - leave off header row if it is strings
- Can also make 1 dimensional or multi "n-dimensional" arrays
- Numpy can perform:
    -  Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
    - Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.
    - Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

## Things I want to know more about
- What is a kernel (I feel like this is something I should know...)
