### Pain and Suffering

(source: https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering and https://www.ashleypennewill.com/essential-topics/pain-vs-suffering/ )
- Pain is how we grow
- suffering is pain without purpose
- "Pain is what happens. Suffering is the story that we layer on top of what happens"

### Beginners Guide to Big O

(source: https://robbell.io/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation)
- used to describe performance of an algorithm
- describes the worst-case (slowest) scenario of the execution time or space usage
- O(1) - an algorithm that will always execute in the same time regardless of the size of the data set
- O(N) - performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 
- O(N2) - performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. Common with algorithms that have nested iterations
- O(2^N) - growth doubles with each addition to the input data set
- Logarithms O(log N) - iterative halving of data sets for binary searches. growth curve peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as size of data set increases

### Names and Values in Python

(source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns)
- assignment never copies data
- function arguments are also assignments (local scope but can conflict with global names)
- No types, any name can be any type at any time and values have no scope
- 

## Things I want to know more about

- I gotta be honest the Suffering vs Pain article has me a bit worried... :)
