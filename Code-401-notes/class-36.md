- The Advice: Communicate!
- First, Restate the Question
- restate the problem to make sure you understand it
- Ask about edge cases
- ask about test cases
- Write pseudocode and ask if it makes sense
- many (most?) interviewers are more interested in how you think than perfect code
- simply being able to reason through the pseudocode is sufficient for many great companies
- Write the actual code and see if it looks good
- Stuck? Ask for Help!
- try making it conversational "I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”

### 7 tips to ace a programming interview

1) Take a few minutes.
    - “Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”
2) Write down the steps of the solution.
3) Write pseudocode first.
4) Don’t sweat the small stuff.
    - They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on
    - If you can’t remember something like this, it’s often acceptable to say that you’d look it up.
5) Sit down. Be humble.
   - Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
   - Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
   - How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
   - Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
   - Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
   - Are you honest (especially about yourself)?
6) Come prepared.
   - there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat)

- this is an interview with Gayle Laakmann McDowell the author of "Cracking the Coding Interview"
- She reemphasized the idea that interviewers care more about how you think than you being able to write perfect code
- she also talked about how important it is to know the basics. We should know the basic data structures really well. LL, queues, BinaryTrees etc. 
- "You aren't hiring people on what they've done, you are hiring them on how they talk about what they've done"


## Things I want to know more about
- This is all review. The articles presented a different strategy for WBs than what we have been taught in codefellows. 
- Will all WB technical interviews expect the same categories we have been trained on? (Problem Domain, Inputs/test cases, Visualization, Algorithm, Big O, Actual code, Step Through)
