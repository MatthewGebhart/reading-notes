- Object-relational mapper - Can define data models entirely in python
- URLs and views - use a module called URLconf to make a mapping between URL paths and Python functions. Like a table of contents for your app
- Templates - template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease, Like using pyhton in HTML
- Forms - a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types
- Authentication - It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.
- Admin - automatic admin interface reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface
- Internationalization - full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones
- Security - Django provides multiple protections against:
  - Clickjacking
  - Cross-site scripting
  - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - SQL injection
  - Remote code execution

- Three typical funding models for open source software:
  - Corporate sponsor - React(Facebook) Angular(Google) etc. 
  - Solo - lead dev gets donations, or does consulting
  - non-profit - org formed to support, promote and advance
- DSF is the Django Software Foundation and handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. 
- Django followed Pythonâ€™s model of having a Benevolent Dictator for Life, that is, a project founder who retained final say for disputes/arguments within the community
