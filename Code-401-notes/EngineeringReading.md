    - Plan - analyse the problem, What steps are necessary?
    - Divide - break into sub-problems and solve individually beginning with simplest. Then connect the dots. 
    - Stuck? - approach with curiosity instead of irritation. 
        - Debug - go step by step through it 
        - Reassess - take a step back and look from another perspective (or start new)
        - Research - Google it up!
