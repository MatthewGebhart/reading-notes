Stacks
- Stacks consists of `Nodes` common terminology
- Push - nodes are pushed into the stack
- Pop - nodes removed are popped off
- Top (top of stack)
- Peek - view value at the top of the stack
- isEmpty - True when stack is empty, otherwise False
- FILO - First in Last Out
- LIFO - Las in First Out
- Push, Pop, Peak, isEmpty are always a O(1) operation because the height of the stack is irrelevant
Queues
- Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
- FIFO - First In First Out
- LILO - Last In Last Out
