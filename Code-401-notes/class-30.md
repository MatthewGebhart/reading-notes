- A hashtable, also known as a hashmap or dictionary in Python, is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of elements.
- WHY:
- Hashtables are useful because they provide constant-time average performance for the basic operations of insertion, deletion, and lookup. This is because they use a technique called hashing to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for fast access to the corresponding values. Hashtables are also useful in situations where you need to store a large amount of data and need to quickly find a specific piece of information.
- WHAT:
- In a hashtable, each key is mapped to a unique index in an array, known as its "hash value." The value is then stored at that index in the array. When looking up a value, the hashtable first calculates the hash value for the key, and then retrieves the value stored at that index in the array.
- HOW:
- In Python, hashtables are implemented as dictionaries.
