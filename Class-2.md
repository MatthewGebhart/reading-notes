# Class 2 notes

## Choosing a text editor

- Best text editor is the one you enjoy using the most
- Features to look for
  - code completion
  - syntax highlighting (colorizes text for easier viewing)
  - nice variety of themes (dark mode is usually preferred)
  - good selections of extensions (plugins for extra powers)
- Emmet - a shorthand language that will speed up code writing
- IDE = Integrated Development Environment

## Command line tutorial

### notes
- echo is not showing bash for me is that a problem?
- *shortcuts* up and down keys can repeat recently used commands
- A *path* is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.
  - *absolute* paths are in relation to the root directory and start with /
  - *relative* paths specify a location in relation to where we currently are
  -  ~ is home (root) directory /users/matthewgebhart .(dot) is current directory  ..(dotdot) is reference to parent directory


### useful commands

- (-) is an option (/) is a argument
- pwd - present working directory
- ls - list (contents of present directory)
  - ls with -l option gives more detailed information
- cd changes directory
  - no option will take to home (root)
- ls -a will list contents of directory with hidden files
