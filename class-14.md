- In the Carnegie Mellon study, the best teams shared two behaviors
  - Members spoke in roughly the same proportion "equality in distribution of conventional turn-taking"
    - Some people spoke more during different tasks, leadership shifted from assignment to assignment. But by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. 
  - Secondly, the good teams all had high "average social sensitivity" - they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
    - "Reading the Mind in the Eyes test - photos of someone eyes and asked to describe what they were thinking or feeling. 
- important: a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. - "Psychological safety"
  - this is somewhat messy and difficult to implement
- Make extra effort to let team members know how their work fit in the larger mission
