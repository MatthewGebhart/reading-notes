# Class 7 Reading notes

## Control Flow

- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
- Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

## JavaScript Functions

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
- A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
- Function *parameters* are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
- the code to be executed by the function is placed inside curly brackets {}
- `function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}`
- The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
  - When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
  - When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
  - Automatically (self invoked)
- Function return
  - When JavaScript reaches a `return` statement, the function will stop executing.

## JavaScript Operators

- The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
  - `let x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x`
- The addition operator (+) adds numbers:
  - `let z = x + y;`
- The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
  - `let z = x * y;`
- The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.
  - `let text1 = "John";
let text2 = "Doe";
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2;`
