# Class 10 - JS Debugging

## Things I want to know more about

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

- Syntax errors
  - These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too
  - Logic errors
    - These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.
- Use the Console to help debug, it will point you to the line of the error

## The JavaScript Debugger

- You can set breakpoints at a line where you want the code to stop running - that could be useful
- Watch Expressions allows you to keep track of expressions that might be causing problems
- Scopes shows what values are visible from various points in your code - also could e very useful. 
- The JavaScript Console is also very useful for debugging... but we already knew that... lol.
